## Objective Function (Machine Learning)
#### What is Objective Function
- Definition:
    - An objective function in [[Machine Learning]] is a mathematical function that quantifies the performance of a model, which the learning algorithm aims to optimize (minimize or maximize) during the training process [(Kronosapiens Labs, 2017)](http://kronosapiens.github.io/blog/2017/03/28/objective-functions-in-machine-learning.html).
    - It provides a formal specification of the problem and guides the model towards optimal parameters [(MathWorks, n.d.)](https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/machine-learning-models.html).
- Examples:
    - [[Mean Squared Error]] (MSE) for [[Regression]]on problems: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
    - Cross-Entropy Loss for [[Classification]] problems: Quantifies the difference between predicted probability distributions and actual class labels.
    - Hinge Loss for Support Vector Machines: Measures the margin violation in classification tasks.
