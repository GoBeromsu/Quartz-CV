## Overfitting
#### What is Overfitting
- Overfitting is a phenomenon where a model excessively fits the training data, resulting in decreased predictive performance on new data. This occurs when the model learns the noise in the training data, leading to reduced generalization performance[(Hawkins, 2004)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2004.03.003).
- Overfitting refers to the situation where a model learns specific patterns in the training dataset too accurately, including meaningless patterns that don't generalize well[(Dietterich, 1995)](https://doi.org/10.1145/212094.212114).
#### Examples
- When a decision tree's depth is increased to perfectly classify all samples in the training data, its performance on new data may deteriorate.
- In neural networks, setting too many epochs during training can lead to overfitting as the model learns noise in the training data.
- In polynomial regression, setting the degree too high can result in a model that fits the training data well but has poor predictive power on new data, indicating overfitting.
